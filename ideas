take user input from stdin to select each task in menu system.
int switch (?) for the user to select different tasks:
1. rotation cipher - encryption - message text and rotation amount key
2. rotation cipher - decryption - cipher text only
3. rotation cipher - decryption - cipher text and rotation amount key
4. substitution cipher - encryption - message text and alphabet substitution key
5. substitution cipher - decryption - cipher text only
6. substitution cipher - decryption - cipher text and alphabet subsitiution key

read message from input with scanf()
read key from input with scanf()
read from a file using the standard file I/O library (stdio.h?)
output decryption sent to stdout and file I/O (create new .txt file, or rewrite dedicated output file, or)
output encryption sent to stdout and file I/O (add to end of dedicated output file, or write extra line on .txt input file?)

Use command line arguments (optional).

Each task should be implemented as a different function.

(advanced) - define the task as part of header inside an input file (.txt) that contains:
* the message and key
* cipher text and key
* or just cipher text
and should contain:
* a single integer placed on the first line to indicate the task to be performed
* #key (# used as indicator for key line. Any other symbol could be used)
* the message or cipher text
txt file needs to be read.
individual lines can be ammended.
can name the text files anything.
take user input to read particular file and ammend message/key?
can read file names as command line arguments (not assessed) - eg main(void) would have void replaced with .txt reading code.

do not encrypt white space, punctuation, or numerals.
if the input is charcter is not a letter, it should be copied to the output unmodified.
upper case letters only - (advanced) convert lower case inputs to upper case.
* if input character ascii number is between 65 - 90 and 97 - 122, then copy to output without modifying
* if input character ascii number is between 97 - 122, then subtract 32 to make it upper case

rotation cipher key is to be a single integer in the range 0 - 25.
encryption with a shift of zero should just produce the initial message as the cipher message.

substitution cipher key is a string of 26 upper case letters in order to their alphabetical substiution.
substitution of a letter with itself should be allowed.
